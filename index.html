					Originally written as a combination of PHP and Javascript, I have updated it to a javascript object for this demo.

					The difficult part was to have the wheel spin a number of times to stop on the chosen winner.  I have output the chosen winner to the console at the start of the spin to show what it will land on.  Lots of mathematics used in this.

					Click on the wheel to spin a new winner.  Good luck!`,
